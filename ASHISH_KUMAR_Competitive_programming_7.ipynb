        " Question 1 Train the AlexNet and ResNet50 CNN models on the CIFAR-10 dataset. A few pointers:\n",
        "• You can load the models directly using the hub APIs. Just set the pretrained flag to False so that you can train from scratch\n",
        "• Print the model summary for each case and note the number of model parameters\n",
        "• As in the previous assignments, work with cross-entropy loss\n",
        "• Use a 70:10:20 data split for training, validation and testing\n",
        "• One not-so-well-defined aspect of training CNNs is when to stop. Monitor your validation loss to decide on when to stop. In other words, stop training when your validation loss starts to increase. If this is taking too many epochs, you can stop at a pre-defined number of epochs that is dependent on your hardware.\n",
        "Report the following:\n",
        "(a) Compute the error on the training and test data sets. Plot the training and test errors as a function of epochs (at the end of training). (1)\n",
        "(b) Visualize the activation maps of the trained model. You can pick a couple of representative slices from the activation volumes at a couple of convolution layers. (1)\n",
        "(c) Report the accuracy of your classifier. (1)\n",
        "(d) Use tSNE to visualize the bottleneck feature at the end of the first epoch and the last epoch. (1)\n",
        "(e) Compare the performance of the two models in terms of the accuracy and training time (number of epochs) required for the training loss to stabilize. Comment on which model you would pick for this task considering a trade-off between performance and the number of parameters. (1)\n"
